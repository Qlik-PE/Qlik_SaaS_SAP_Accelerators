## Description:
The SAP Accelerators take RAW SAP data from ECC or HANA and turn into Analytics ready data with Qlik SaaS Analytics using prebuilt dashboards.

The process extracts the data required for three initial SAP use cases 
 - Orders to Cash 
 - Inventory Management 
 - Financial Analytics

The extracted data is then transformed using the Qlik Cloud Data Integration engine into Analytic ready data marts. The process also turns RAW shorthand german codes into readable business terms and consolidates the dimensional data into reusable and shared assets for the various SAP Fact data. That end result is then cataloged and fed into the Qlik SaaS Analytics layer for consumption by business users.
